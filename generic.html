								<p>With an aim to keep the humanity alove within people and help everyone who is in need and to make them indpendent, we make every try to uplift the domains we work for. We have several events for the people we help to make them aware of other people in a imilar situation showcasing their talents through their passion they ever wanted to follow once. With events, we make sure that they have a proper health and diet so as to maintain themselves and as soon as they are ready to become independent we wish them luck for their future endeavours.</p>
								<p>As in the case of education to childern we provide them education free of cost with the donations recieved to us. And as soon as they are ready for their jobs or to follow their passion or their career we then give them a small base amount to start a life which could take them to the skies with their skills. We have many cases in which they have been the biggest donors since they have experienced the trust and owe us as a reason to reaching at the stages in their lives. It is our immense pleasure to take that donations and carry forward for their next batches. With major donations we have future plans to open our schools and colleges so as to assure their education in their shelters.</p>
